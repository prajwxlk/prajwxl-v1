This blog is a Work In Progress. I'll keep updating it as I make progress with the Vesuvius Challenge. If you don't know about the Vesuvius Challenge, you can learn more about it [here](https://scrollprize.org/).

## I am still learing and reading about this challenge. I shall be sharing the notes I make here + the progress with the code. I am very excited to work on this challenge!

The first thing I am doing is going through the resources provided on the website and reading through all the conent they firstly have on their website, post which I'd pick and deep dive into the resources they've provided to us. They also do have a Discord community which I've joined.

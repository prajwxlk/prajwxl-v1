summary: 'Discussing about how access to powerful AI models to regular developers is opening up new doors for usage of AI use cases'

I've been interested in Tech for years. Fascinated about it as a kid and have been constantly learning new things and technologies which are being launched as time passed. One of the technologies which I was very fascinated about for a long time was Artificial Intelligence (I got to know about machine learning quite later). All image which I had in my mind of Artificial Intelligence though was having physical robots who could think for themselves and do complicated to easy tasks on giving some simple inputs by us humans.

All though as I recently got into learning more it shows that it's just not about robots but there are many more cases in which this could be applied. For example, AI could help in diagnosis of Cancer, Analysis of pricings of Real Estate and lots. Though, one of things which comes to using this technology is that you need to understand and be able to apply machine learning. Well, ML does definitely take a good amount of time to understand and be able to train and use all of the models. It also is not limited to tech but data and statistics as well.

Now, recently in this space a company called OpenAI has done all of the hard work of training these models on literally billions of parameters which would have been really hard to do especially accounting for the costs which would have been required to undertake this initiative. Though after all of this, anyone can apply and access these well trained models and use them in their applications just by mere API requests. Now this is mindblowing, literally people with no idea about ML can be using these technologies and building some killer use cases.

These models have some really good advantages which makes it easy for the regular developers to interact with it. Many people have been building businesses which are helping lots of people save time and do things more efficiently right from writing copy for their products to using this for data analysis. The opportunity to use such powerful models gives a gateway to a completely new set of use cases which could be applied and are popping up everyday by the usage of this.

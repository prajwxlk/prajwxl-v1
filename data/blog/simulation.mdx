![A moment from GTA San Andreas](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73160418/135382608-fabed766-ee09-44ce-be47-f53c52feb90d.png)

Well, I remember while playing GTA San Andreas, I went inside a store (I guess) and inside, there was a Arcade Gaming Machine. Looking at that, my interest peaked and I smashed the enter button to see if I could play it and to my surprise I could!!. I clearly can't recall what game was in the arcade, it was kind of the spaceship attacking meteorites in the path or something. Like a retro game.

I played for a while but once I was done playing the game, I remember staring at the wall and thinking. Well, I was playing a game, inside of which I was playing a game. That means I was controlling a spaceship inside a game which was inside a game. Damn!!

What if, I am the person who is on the Earth and someone is controlling my actions who is in turn being controlled by someone else?

Woah!! How do I know if this is true? What If all that I am thinking and what I am writing right now is not being written by me but someone or something playing the game called "The Universe"?

Is it that as we travel to far places, they get loaded as they do in games? If so, are our lives nothing but a simulation?
